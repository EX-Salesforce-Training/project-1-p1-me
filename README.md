# Project Explanation and Overview
This project was done individually by Daniela, whose app was developed for COVID-19 screening form. An ERD was created for this specific case, and the custom objects needed to meet the project's objective. The crucial object created was the survey, which contained the questions (symptoms) as fields, in which the user had to answer them. 
A flow was created to automate the creation of the survey for the user. In case the user presents any system, that is, to answer yes to any of the questions, the HR department and the manager would be notified, and for that he creates a task associated with these two and sent an email using the Workflow tool.
I also created a community to demonstrate how the user could complete the survey and also created an unmanage package so that it is possible for others to install the created app.

Bearing in mind that the project was developed only by me, I created a kanban board to organize the tasks I had to do, as already done and the ones in progress, and for each of the tasks, the time it took me to implement them.
